# NeuralNetworkDashboard
Deploys a fast neural network dashboard to monitor data training and other activities.

The images are placeholders for varying input types. Check back for updates to this project as it grows.

To run, use "python dashboard.py"

The dash module and other dependencies are needed. A requirements.txt file will be added later since this project

did not originate from an isolated environment.
